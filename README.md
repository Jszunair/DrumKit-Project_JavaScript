# Drum Kit Project ü•Å

This Drum Kit project is a JavaScript application where users can press specific keys on their keyboard to play different drum sounds. It uses a `keypress` event listener to make the experience interactive, allowing users to play sounds in a virtual drum kit by simply pressing the matching keys.

## Project Purpose
The main goal of this project is to practice:
- **Event Handling**: Learning how to handle `keypress` events in JavaScript.
- **Audio Playback**: Using JavaScript‚Äôs `Audio` object to load and play sounds.
- **Switch Statements**: Simplifying complex conditions with switch statements to trigger different audio files based on key presses.

## How to Use
Press the following keys on your keyboard to play the corresponding drum sound:
- **W**: Plays `tom-4.mp3`
- **A**: Plays `tom-3.mp3`
- **S**: Plays `tom-2.mp3`
- **D**: Plays `tom-1.mp3`
- **J**: Plays `crash.mp3`
- **K**: Plays `snare.mp3`
- **L**: Plays `kick-bass.mp3`

## How to Practice with This Project
- **Experiment with Sounds**: Swap out the current audio files for other sounds to make a unique drum set.
- **Add More Keys**: Add additional keys to the switch statement and assign new sounds for an expanded drum kit.
- **Visual Feedback**: Enhance the project by adding animations or color changes when a key is pressed.
- **Refactor Code**: Try optimizing the switch statement with an object lookup for even cleaner code.

## Conclusion
This Drum Kit project is a simple, interactive way to strengthen your JavaScript skills by working with event listeners and audio playback. It‚Äôs an excellent project to explore how to create interactive effects using JavaScript.

Happy Coding!
